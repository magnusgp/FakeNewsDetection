MLOPS project description - Classifying real and fake news
==============================

**Overall goal of the project**\
The overall goal of this project is to classify news articles as either fake or real. 

**What framework are you going to use (Kornia, Transformer, Pytorch-Geometrics)**\
We will use the Transformer framework.

**How to you intend to include the framework into your project:**\
Since the Transformers repository from the Huggingface group is focused on NLP models, it is a perfect fit for our project.
So we intend to use some of the pre-trained models on our dataset, and if possible, try to improve performance further.

**What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)**\
We are going to use a dataset obtained from kaggle.com (link) containing both fake and real news articles. 
The dataset contains the following attributes: title, text, subject and date.

**What deep learning models to you expect to use:**\
We intend to use some of the pre-trained models from the Transformer framework. We have not yet determined which.
